# Getting Started with Axonyx Revolt

## Welcome! üéâ
You're about to set up an AI agent that can automate Windows 11 through natural language. This guide will get you up and running in 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites ‚úÖ

### Required
- ‚úÖ **Windows 11**
- ‚úÖ **Python 3.12+** ([Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- ‚úÖ **Anthropic API key** ([Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

### Optional (for GUI)
- ‚úÖ **Flutter 3.35+** ([Installation Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows))
  - Download Flutter SDK
  - Extract to `C:\flutter`
  - Add `C:\flutter\bin` to PATH
  - Run `flutter doctor` to verify

## Installation Steps

### Quick Start (CLI Agent)

#### Step 1: Get Python Ready

Open PowerShell and verify Python:
```powershell
python --version
```

You should see Python 3.12 or higher. If not, install Python first.

#### Step 2: Clone Repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/axonyx-revolt.git
cd axonyx-revolt
```

#### Step 3: Run Automated Setup

```powershell
.\start.ps1
```

This script will:
1. ‚úÖ Create Python virtual environment (.venv)
2. ‚úÖ Install all required packages
3. ‚úÖ Create .env configuration file
4. ‚úÖ Launch the CLI agent

**Note:** If you get an execution policy error, run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### Step 4: Add Your API Key

When prompted, you'll need to:
1. Open the `.env` file that was created
2. Replace `your_anthropic_api_key_here` with your actual API key
3. Save the file

Your `.env` should look like:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION=true
```

#### Step 5: Start Automating! üöÄ

The agent will launch automatically. Try these starter commands:

**Beginner Tasks:**
```
"Create a folder called 'test' on my Desktop"
"What's my CPU usage?"
"List all files in my Downloads folder"
"Open Notepad"
```

**Intermediate Tasks:**
```
"Is Google Chrome installed?"
"Launch Calculator and maximize it"
"Switch to dark mode"
"Set power plan to high performance"
```

**Advanced Tasks:**
```
"Install 7-Zip from C:/Downloads/7zip-installer.exe silently"
"Launch Notepad, type 'Hello World', and press Enter"
"Check if VS Code is installed, if not, tell me how to install it"
```

## Understanding the Agent

## Flutter GUI Setup (Optional)

### Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Flutter 3.35+ installed and in PATH
- ‚úÖ Python agent already setup (above steps completed)

### Step 1: Run GUI Setup
```powershell
.\setup_gui.ps1
```

This will:
1. ‚úÖ Verify Flutter installation
2. ‚úÖ Check Python virtual environment
3. ‚úÖ Install FastAPI and Uvicorn (backend)
4. ‚úÖ Download Flutter dependencies
5. ‚úÖ Enable Windows desktop support
6. ‚úÖ Generate Windows runner files

### Step 2: Launch GUI + Backend
```powershell
# Launch both (recommended)
.\launch_gui.ps1 -Both

# OR launch separately:
.\launch_gui.ps1 -Backend  # Start API server
.\launch_gui.ps1 -GUI      # Start Flutter app
```

### Step 3: Use the GUI
- üé® **Frameless design** with purple/cyan gradient
- üí¨ **Chat interface** - type commands naturally
- üéõÔ∏è **Model selector** - switch between models
- üü¢ **Connection status** - shows backend connectivity
- üîß **Tool badges** - see what tools executed

### GUI Features
- Message history with timestamps
- Tool execution tracking (success/error badges)
- Model selection dropdown (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
- Empty state with suggestion chips
- Drag-to-move frameless window
- Custom title bar with window controls

## Understanding the Agent

### How It Works

1. **You ask** in natural language: "Install app X and launch it"
2. **Claude thinks**: Breaks down into: check if installed ‚Üí install ‚Üí launch
3. **Agent executes**: Calls appropriate Windows automation tools (77 total)
4. **You get results**: Success message or detailed output

### Safety Features

- **Confirmation Mode** (CLI only): Asks before each action
- **Error Handling**: Tools won't crash your system
- **Validation**: Checks paths, file existence, etc.
- **GUI Mode**: Auto-execute (no confirmations)

To change confirmation setting for CLI, edit `.env`:
```env
REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION=true   # Ask before each action (CLI default)
REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION=false  # Auto-execute (GUI mode)
```

```

### Batch Installation
```
"Is Chrome installed? What about 7-Zip? List all installed applications."
```

### System Maintenance
```
"Show me CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space. Then list the top 10 processes by memory."
```

### Application Testing
```
"Launch Notepad, wait for it to open, type 'Test', press Enter, then close without saving."
```

## Troubleshooting

### "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set"
- Make sure `.env` file exists in the project root
- Check that you've added your API key
- Restart the agent after editing `.env`

### "Import could not be resolved" errors
- These are just IDE warnings before packages are installed
- Run `.\start.ps1` or manually install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Make sure virtual environment is activated: `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

### "Access Denied" errors
- Some operations need administrator privileges
- Right-click PowerShell ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"
- Try again

### Agent doesn't understand commands
- Be specific: "Launch notepad.exe" not "open notepad"
- Use full paths: "C:/Users/YourName/Desktop" not "Desktop"
- Break complex tasks into steps

### pyautogui failsafe triggered
- You moved mouse to corner (safety feature)
- Disable if needed (not recommended): Edit `ui_automation.py`

## Tips for Success

### 1. Start Simple
Begin with basic tasks to understand how the agent works:
- File operations
- Opening applications
- System information queries

### 2. Use Confirmation Mode
Keep `REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION=true` until you're comfortable with what the agent does.

### 3. Be Specific
Good: "Install 7-Zip from C:/Downloads/7z1900-x64.exe silently"
Bad: "install something"

### 4. Test in Safe Environment
- Use a test folder for file operations
- Test installations in VM if possible
- Don't automate critical system operations until confident

### 5. Learn the Capabilities
- Read `examples/EXAMPLE_TASKS.md` for inspiration
- Check `examples/ADVANCED_EXAMPLES.md` for complex workflows
- Review the tool documentation in each `tools/*.py` file

## Next Steps

### Explore Examples
```powershell
# Run example scripts
python examples/automation_examples.py

```

## Ready to Automate! üéâ

You now have a powerful Windows automation agent at your fingertips. Start with simple tasks, build confidence, then create amazing automation workflows.

**Remember:** The agent is as smart as Claude, but you're still in control. Use confirmation mode, start small, and gradually build up to complex automations.

Happy automating! üöÄ
