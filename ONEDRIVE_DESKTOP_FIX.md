# OneDrive Desktop Issue - FIXED

## The Problem

You have **OneDrive Desktop folder redirection** enabled. This means:
- Your visible Desktop is at: `C:\Users\Jemisha Roy JXT\OneDrive\Desktop`
- But `Path.home() / "Desktop"` points to: `C:\Users\Jemisha Roy JXT\Desktop` (local, hidden folder)

When the agent saved screenshots to "Desktop", they went to the local Desktop folder, not your OneDrive Desktop that you actually see!

## The Fix

Updated `screen_reader.py` to detect the **actual Desktop path** from Windows Registry:
- Reads: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders\Desktop`
- This gives the real Desktop path, whether it's local or OneDrive-redirected
- Now all screenshots save to the Desktop you actually see!

## How It Works Now

When you say "save to Desktop/myfile.png":
1. Agent checks Windows Registry for your actual Desktop location
2. Expands environment variables (handles OneDrive paths)
3. Saves to: `C:\Users\Jemisha Roy JXT\OneDrive\Desktop\myfile.png`
4. You see it immediately on your Desktop!

## Test It

Restart the agent and try:
```
Take a screenshot and save it to Desktop/test.png
```

It will now appear on your visible OneDrive Desktop!

## Previous Screenshot Location

The earlier screenshot was saved to:
- Expected: `C:\Users\Jemisha Roy JXT\OneDrive\Desktop\anthropic_billing_screenshot.png`
- Actually went to: `C:\Users\Jemisha Roy JXT\Desktop\anthropic_billing_screenshot.png` (hidden local folder)

That's why you couldn't see it! The fix prevents this from happening again.
