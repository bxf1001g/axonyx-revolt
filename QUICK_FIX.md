# Quick Fix Summary - Screenshot Path Issue

## What Happened

The agent tried to save a screenshot to `Desktop/anthropic_billing.png` but the path wasn't properly expanded to the full path like `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\anthropic_billing.png`.

## What Was Fixed

Updated `take_screenshot()` in `screen_reader.py` to properly handle relative paths:
- If path starts with "Desktop", "Documents", "Downloads", or "Pictures"
- Automatically expands it to full path: `Path.home() / save_path`

## OCR Issue

The Tesseract OCR error shows it's looking for language data file but can't find it. This means Tesseract either:
1. Not installed yet
2. Installed but `TESSDATA_PREFIX` environment variable not set
3. Language data files missing

## Quick Solution

**Restart the agent** and try again:
```powershell
python src/main.py
```

Then run your task again. The screenshot will now save correctly.

For the balance extraction (OCR):
- **Option 1**: Install Tesseract from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
- **Option 2**: Manually read the balance from the Chrome window ($4.61)

The agent will now:
1. ✅ Open Chrome with your profile → Billing page
2. ✅ Take screenshot → Saves to full Desktop path
3. ⚠️ Extract balance → Needs Tesseract (or you provide manually)
4. ✅ Open Notepad
5. ✅ Create balance.txt with the amount
6. ✅ Save to Desktop
